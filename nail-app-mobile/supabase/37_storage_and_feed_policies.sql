-- ============================================================================
-- Storage + Feed Policies (Run-Now Script)
-- File: 37_storage_and_feed_policies.sql
-- Purpose:
--   1) Ensure upload permissions to Storage for logged-in users
--   2) (Optionally) make user-uploads bucket public for MVP
--   3) Add saved_looks RLS policies for inserts and reads
--   4) Add helpful index for feed ordering
-- Notes:
--   - Idempotent: safe to re-run; policies are created only if missing.
--   - Adjust the SELECT policy at the bottom depending on private vs public feed.
-- ============================================================================

-- 0) (Optional) Make user-uploads public for MVP (reads via getPublicUrl)
--    Comment out if you prefer private + signed download URLs.
