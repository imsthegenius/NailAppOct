-- French Refinement via RGB Distance to White
-- File: 34_french_rgb_distance.sql
-- Purpose: Capture near-whites that HSL may misclassify by using RGB distance
--          from pure white. Safe to re-run. Rebuilds display_order.
-- Prereq: Run 32_hex_only_categorization.sql first (for HSL columns), and/or
--         33_refine_hex_rules.sql. This script is an extra safety net.
